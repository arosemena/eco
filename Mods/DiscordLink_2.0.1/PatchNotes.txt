2.0.0

--- Additions ---
* Support for Eco 9.0
  - WOHO!

* Configuration Verification
Upon startup and configuration changes, DiscordLink will now process your configuration to look for errors.
The verification runs in two steps, one at the server start and one after all information from Discord has been received.
Any detected errors will be sent to the server log and errors that can be fixed automatically will be resolved.
The status of each channel link will be displayed at the end of the full verification pass.
Configuration verification is also triggered by configuration changes made while the server is running.

* DiscordInvite Command
A new command for both Eco and Discord that displays a cofigurable message containing the invite link to the Discord server.
Note that this command requires the Discord Address parameter from the Eco Network config to be set.

* Discord mention/tagging support
Use @NameOrRole or #ChannelName in Eco to tag users, roles or channels in Discord.
Usage of the various types of mentions can be allowed or disallowed per channel link.

* Live Eco Server Status Display
A live updated and configurable display of the ?EcoStatus output can now be housed in a Discord channel.

* Chatlog
A chatlog that stores all messages sent in the linked channels.
This feature is off by default and the path of the chatlog is configurable.

--- Bugfixes & Improvements ---
* Fixed messages from Eco sometimes not being sent to Discord.

* Discord guild(server) and channel names are no longer case sensitive.

--- Notes ---
* Changed Config Name
The config name has changed to "DiscordLink.eco".
This means that your current config file will no longer be recognized.
As the content of the config file has changed to some extent, we recommend that you do not simply rename your existing configuration file, but rather fill out the new one.

* Multiple DLLs
DiscordLink has previously been distributed as a single .dll file.
Due to underlying changes, we will now also distrubute the .dll files of our dependencies. DSharpPlus.dll and DSharplus.CommandsNext.dll should simply be left in the same folder as DiscordLink.dll

--- Known Issues ---
* The Live Server Status feature may cause crashes if other messages already exist in the Discord channel when the plugin starts

* Chatlog will sometimes fail to write.
